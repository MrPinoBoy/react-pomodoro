## Introduction

My second react project is a configurable timer. You can add or remove 10 seconds by pressing the *+* or *-* buttons. You can also start or pause the timer, and reset it to the same time as your last timer.

## Development

Since this is my second react project, it's probably filled with flaws. It was bundled using [parcel](https://parceljs.org/). I didn't struggle too much coding it, but it is far more optimisable. I'll keep working on it, refactoring most of the animation controls. I may also need to rethink the way the different play states are handled, to facilitate my work. The styling is yet to be finished, but I'd like to really push it to the limits.

## Struggles

UseRefs are a bit obscure to me still, that's why there's a lot of querySelectors in the code. 

Timing and resetting the animations was and is still complicated, it's far from perfect and maybe I'll find a solution later on that will make it all very simple.

## To-do list

- Replace querySelectors by useRefs
- ~~Refactor animation related functions~~
- ~~Rethink the +, - and reset buttons functionalities~~
- ~~Finish modal screen functionnalities~~
- ~~Style the buttons and the modal screen~~
- Maybe add sounds?
- Pretty up the code (done-ish)

## Conclusion

~~Even though it is not finished, I'm pretty proud of this project. The react app is working really well, it is just the styling that still has bugs and problems, since it is a bit complicated.~~

I really enjoy working in react, it is really powerful and fun, I feel like the learning curve isn't steep at all.


Thanks for checking out this project !
